# Design, Analysis and Validation of an Industrial Lifting Hook

## Summary
A project to design in Autodesk Inventor, and optimise with the use of static ANSYS FEA, and stress test in real life, achieving 95%.

## Constraints
The hook, with strict and unique specification, was analysed in combination with a test assembly to more accurately simulate forces in FEA.

## Design and Analysis
The hook was designed with minimal mass in mind, for performance and material cost. The design features holes to reduce mass, and a modified pin hole to better distribute stresses. A 5mm mesh was applied to the test assembly, and 1.2mm mesh applied to the hook. The hook was predicted to yield at 22kN and fail at 53kN, where stresses reached 630MPa. This gave a 131kN/kg ratio.

## Validation
The hook was then manufactured and experience a tensile test, reaching 99kN/kg, not performing to estimates - an important lesson.
